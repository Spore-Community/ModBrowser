<h2 id="register">Registration</h2>

<h3 id="registergame">Creating your Spore account</h3>
<p>A Spore persona is needed to use online features for Spore.</p>
<p>Your Spore persona is linked to an EA/Origin account. Note that your Spore and Origin screen names may be different, depending on how you set up your account. Your Spore screen name cannot be changed, but you can add up to 5 personas per EA/Origin account at http://www.spore.com/view/screenNameManage</p>
<p>To create a Spore persona:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open Spore</li>
    <li>On the screen that shows after the intro you will see three boxes at the bottom of the window</li>
    <li>Enter your EA/Origin account email and password in the first two boxes, then add the name you want to use in Spore on the right (you can add more through the website later)</li>
    <li>Click Register</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The email address and password you use with the EA app, Origin, at www.ea.com, or in other EA games, is the same email and password you should use for Spore. If in doubt, go to EA.com and try to login with your email. If it exists, that is your account. If it doesn't, create an account with EA before loading Spore.</p>

<h3 id="registerorigin">Registering Spore on EA/Origin</h3>
<p>If you purchased Spore on other services, and cannot register in-game, or simply need to download the game from Origin, follow these instructions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://myaccount.ea.com/cp-ui/redemption/index">https://myaccount.ea.com/cp-ui/redemption/index</a>, log with your EA/Origin Account email and password</li>
    <li>Redeem your codes (Spore, Galactic Adventures, Creepy & Cute Parts Pack) codes from non-EA/Origin locations</li>
    <ul>
        <li>IMPORTANT! For base game, make sure to redeem actual game and not the Spore Community Access</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Open the game and create a Spore account (if you haven't already) using the instructions above</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also redeem the codes from disc, Steam or GOG directly in the EA/Origin app if you have it installed and if they haven't been attached to an account already.</p>
<p>If you get the message that your code has already been used, contact EA Support at https://help.ea.com and have your serial code ready to give to the representative. They will be able to help you out.</p>

<h2 id="update">Updating the Game</h2>
<p>If you installed Spore from one of the above services (EA app, Origin, Steam, GOG) after March 2017, you already have the latest version of the game.</p>
<p>The latest version of the game is required to use online features.</p>

<h4>For disc users</h4>
<p>The disc versions of Spore no longer support online features. If you would like to use Spore's online features, you may <a href="getspore#registerorigin">redeem a free EA/Origin copy of the game</a>.</p>
<p>Please manually update to <a>Patch 1.5.1</a> if you plan to continue using the disc version. Other versions of the game do not require the patch.</p>

<h3>Checking your Spore version</h3>
<p>If you need to check if you have the latest version of Spore, open the following two folders:</p>
<h4 class="accent-orange">Origin</h4>
<ul>
    <li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Spore\Sporebin</li>
    <li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Spore Galactic Adventures\SporebinEP1</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="spore-neutral">Steam</h4>
<ul>
    <li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Spore\Sporebin</li>
    <li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Spore Galactic Adventures\SporebinEP1</li>
</ul>
<p>If the game was installed from disc, the EA app, or GOG, the path may vary.</p>
<p>In both folders, there should be a SporeApp application file (this is the actual Spore application). Right-click this file, and click Properties. Go to the Details tab. In the list, you will see "File version". If the numbers match here, you have a supported version of Spore for modding.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spore File version 1.3.0.29 or 1.3.0.22</li>
    <li>Galactic Adventures File version 3.1.0.29 or 3.1.0.22</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an outdated version of the game, you must uninstall the game and all expansions, and then reinstall from EA/Origin.</p>

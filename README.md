# Spore Mod Browser - GitHub Pages branch

This branch contains the live website for Spore Mod Browser. The files here are hosted by GitHub Pages and accessible at https://mods.sporecommunity.com

The contents of this branch (and consequently, the live website) are automatically built from the [SporeCommunity.ModBrowser.Blazor project in the main branch](https://github.com/Spore-Community/ModBrowser/tree/main/SporeCommunity.ModBrowser.Blazor). For this reason, do not push to this branch directly. All contents are overwritten when the main branch is updated.
